We had the start and i just spent the entire day figuring out how i would wanna do the game. I decided i want the algea to be moving from left to right instead of the mermaid.

14.012025
I stared to implement the algea as just a streched green recktangle. I did manage to get it to move and dissapear but for some reason it is flickering and sometimes the random placed inbetween gaps are too random making it not playable.

15.01.2025
I imported a fish just to see where i would like to place the mermaid it has no collison or anything yet. Fixed the algea with the help of a tutor tho.
I messed up the random value and we placed it correctly therefore the algeagaps are now all in the screen not pushing each other out and the flickering
i had a problem with was cause by me having something in there double and therefore not loading properly.

With Florians help the entire thing got made oop. The shells now spawn randomly the algea doesn't go out of screen anymore.

17.01.2025
The shells now dont spawn in the algea and i have a counter that goes up when u touch the algea. Collion with the top and bottom of the canvas doesnt work yet tho

20.01.2025
i stared implementing the mermaid sprites now she is flopping around. The Algea doesnt flicker around anymore now because the loading of it is fixed now. I have now pretty backgrounds as well because i stared working on them

With help from a tutor the mermaid now can't swim out on the top meaning everything has collision now.
