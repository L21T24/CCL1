13.01.2025 – Initial Planning
The project kickoff! I spent the entire day figuring out how I wanted the gameplay to work. Instead of having the mermaid move from left to right, I decided to keep her static and make the algae move instead.

14.01.2025 – Implementing Algae Movement
I started by implementing the algae as a simple stretched green rectangle. I managed to get it moving and disappearing, but I encountered one major issues:
    -The randomly generated gaps between the algae were sometimes placed in a way that made the game unplayable.

15.01.2025 – Fixing Algae Generation & Adding a Fish
I imported a fish sprite to test the mermaid's placement, though it had no collision yet.
With the help of a tutor, I fixed the algae's random gap placement. The issue was caused by an incorrect random value assignment, which led to gaps pushing each other out of view.

16.01.2025 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Refactor
Florian helped me refactor the game to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
    -Shells now spawn randomly.

17.01.2025 – Improving Collisions & Counter Implementation
    -Shells now spawn without overlapping with the algae.
    -I added a counter that increases when the mermaid touches the shells.
    -Collision detection for the top and bottom of the canvas is still missing.

18.01.2025 – Rest Day
Took a well-deserved break.

19.01.2025 – Artwork Begins
I started drawing the comic and the mermaid sprite.

20.01.2025 – Mermaid Animation & Backgrounds
    -Began implementing the mermaid’s sprites; she now flops around when moving.
    -The algae no longer flicker because the loading issue was finally fixed.
    -I created and implemented pretty background images.
    -Added a start and end screen.

21.01.2025 – Collision System Completed
With the help of a tutor, I added collision detection that prevents the mermaid from swimming out of the top of the screen.

22.01.2025 – Animated Pot Added
I created the pot sprite and animated it. And fixed small details around the game.

23.01.2025 – Fixing Animations & UI Polish
    -Spent the entire day fixing the animations for the comic in the start screen.
    -Adjusted the pot animation on the end screen.

24.01.2025 – Final Presentation Day
The game is complete, and I presented it!
