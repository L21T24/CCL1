We had the start and i just spent the entire day figuring out how i would wanna do the game. I decided i want the algea to be moving from left to right instead of the mermaid.

I stared to implement the algea as just a streched green recktangle. I did manage to get it to move and dissapear but for some reason it is flickering and sometimes the random placed inbetween gaps are to random making it not playable.

I imported a fish just to see where i would like to place the mermaid it has no collison or anything yet. Fixed the algea with the help of a tutor tho.
I messed up the random value and we placed it correctly therefore the algeagaps are now all in the screen not pushing each other out and the flickering
i had a problem with was cause by me having something in there double and therefore not loading properly.
