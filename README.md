# ðŸŽ® **Game Title** 

Collect as many shiny shells as possible for your momâ€™s dinnerâ€”but watch out! The moving algae create tricky gaps that youâ€™ll need to skillfully swim through. One wrong move, and youâ€™ll get caught!

## Challenges:
   -Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Struggles: Understanding and properly applying OOP concepts, such as classes and inheritance, was difficult. Structuring the code efficiently took more time than expected.
    
  -Physics Tweaks: Fine-tuning gravity, jump force, and collision detection to make the game feel natural was trickier than anticipated.
  
  -Game Loop Issues: Ensuring a consistent frame rate and properly resetting the game after a loss presented some challenges.
   

## Lessons Learned:

  -OOP Practice is Key: Breaking down the game into manageable classes helped, but I need more experience with structuring code efficiently.
  
  -Debugging Strategies Matter: Learning to debug collision issues and refine movement physics was valuable for future projects.
  
  -Start Simple: Beginning with a minimal working version and gradually adding features made the development process more manageable.
